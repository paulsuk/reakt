General things:

Master Branch - our most recent thing that works

Develop Branch - the common branch that we will be pushing our code into (once we are happy with develop, we will merge to master)

When you wanna start working on something:
- git pull origin develop (makes sure you are up to date with develop)
- git checkout -b "branch name" (just make it your name)


When you have made some changes
- git pull origin develop

if it works:
- git add *
- git commit -m "commit message"
- git push origin branchname (so probably your name)

If you get some error that there are some merge conflicts, and that it will abort:
- git rm * (un commits/adds your things)
- git stash (Saves your changes)
- git pull origin develop (gets the updated code)
- git stash pop (gets your saved new work)
- deal with merge conflicts (ask paul/zaid or if you know how to do it)
